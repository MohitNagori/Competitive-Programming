// Linear Regression 
Y = a + bX
then b = p * sigma(Y)/sigma(x)


So, 
-> y = -2 -3/4x 
  -> Here b = p * sigma(Y)/sigma(x) = -3/4        // Equation 1

-> x = -7/4 -3/4y 
  -> Here b = p * sigma(X)/sigma(Y) = -3/4        // Equation 2
    

Now Equation 1 * Equation 2
->  b^2 =  (p * sigma(Y)/sigma(x)) * (p * sigma(X)/sigma(Y))
  -> 9/16 = p^2
    -> p = 3/4 | -3/4
    

-> Slopes are negative -> negative correlation -> p = -3/4
