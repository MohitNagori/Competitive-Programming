Day 2: Basic Probability
-> 5/6
Total 36 choice.
Choice that voilate condition -> {(4, 6), (6, 4), (5,5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6,6)} -> (36 - 6)/36 -> 5/6



Day 2: More Dice
-> 1/9 
Choice that fulfil condition -> {(1,5), (5,1), (2, 4), (4, 2)} -> 4/36 -> 1/9 



Day 2: Compound Event Probability
-> Probability of 2R1B -> RRB + RBR + BRR
-> (4/7 * 5/9 * 4*8) + (4/7 * 4/9 * 4*8) + (3/7 * 5/9 * 4*8) 
-> 80/504 + 64/504 + 60/504
-> 204/504 -> 17/42
